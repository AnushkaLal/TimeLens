## Why TimeLens

Modern life compresses time:

- 📱 Hours vanish behind screens  
- 🧠 Thoughts replay endlessly  
- 🚶 Habits drift into autopilot  
- 😔 Emotional energy rises and falls unnoticed  

TimeLens **turns your journal + images into awareness**, highlighting:  

- What consumed your time  
- Emotional & cognitive load  
- Grounding moments that slowed the day  

> 📝 Think of it as a **life reflection / personal pathology-style awareness report**
