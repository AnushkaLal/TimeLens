# 🕰️ TimeLens  
### *Making time visible again*

> ⚡ Do you feel like days are flying by? Weeks blur together, hours vanish, and screen time dominates.  
> TimeLens is a **privacy-first, Gemini-powered reflection tool** that helps you notice your **habits, emotions, and how time moves through your day** — without judgment or storing personal identity.

## Why TimeLens

Modern life compresses time:

- 📱 Hours vanish behind screens  
- 🧠 Thoughts replay endlessly  
- 🚶 Habits drift into autopilot  
- 😔 Emotional energy rises and falls unnoticed  

TimeLens **turns your journal + optional images into awareness**, highlighting:  

- What consumed your time  
- Emotional & cognitive load  
- Habit & health patterns  
- Grounding moments that slowed your day  

> 📝 Think of it as a **life reflection / personal pathology-style awareness report**, without storing any personal identifiers.

## 🤖 Why Gemini?

TimeLens relies on Gemini as a **reasoning engine**, not just a text generator:

- Understands free-form journaling  
- Reason across emotional, behavioral, and time-based signals  
- Analyze text and images together  
- Abstract identifying details into generalized patterns  
- Return structured, meaningful insights in one API call  

> This project uses `gemini-2.5-flash` for optimal free-tier performance.

## 🔐 Privacy-First by Design

TimeLens intentionally avoids:

- Names  
- Locations  
- Organizations  
- Personal identifiers  
- Long-term memory  

All experiences are transformed into **anonymous patterns**, making the tool safe, ethical, and reflective.
